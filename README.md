## Intro, Technologies and Installation 
Intro: This is a chatting app, plain and simple. <br/>

Node.js was used along express.js and several npm packages (see Trello PACKAGE.JSON). Mostly though, this app utilizes websockets provided by  <a href='https://socket.io/'>socket.io</a>. Using websockets allows for messages to be rendered automatically on client side, without needing to refresh the page.</br>

The giphy API was utilized. Thank you <a href='https://giphy.com/'>Giphy</a>. Users can click on the GIF! button to post a random GIF that matches the query, and if there is no match, nothing will be submitted.


## Startup Instructions and functionality
First and foremost, only users who are signed up and logged in can access the app. Its FREEE! <br/><br/>
Two <i> super </i> models are used in this app.  </br></br> The first model is the users. Users can edit their name and email address, which appears in the users list on the home page. </br> </br>
The second model is the chats. This model belongs to the user, in other words, every chat will have the user's name who posted it.
